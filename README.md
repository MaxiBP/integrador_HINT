## Metal Detector 

This project was developed in the course HINT (Herramientas Informáticas y Nuevas Tecnologías), part of the Physics degree Program, which i took to complement my learning in Arduino, C, and Python.
Using and Arduino Uno board together with the QMC5883L compass module, the code functions as a simple metal detector. It represents the first stage of a larger project aimed at detecting magnetic ink used in bees to locate the queen.

As mentioned, the project was developed by physics students and myself, at a time when I did not yet have experience with proper commit practices or project structuring. Even so, I still find this project fun to revisit and experiment with, and it has the potential to continue evolving, so it could be considered unfinished.
